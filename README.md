# Alter-Image

This program allows you to apply different effects upon an image, and then see how the image looks.

For example, here is a base image:

![Base Dragons](https://github.com/Diusrex/Alter-Image/blob/master/Examples/baseImage.jpg)

and then with the channels swapped so red and blue are at the intesity that green was, and green is at the intensity that red was at:
![Now purple dragons](https://github.com/Diusrex/Alter-Image/blob/master/Examples/Swap%20Channel%20R1G0B1.jpg)

For a trippy image, you can, instead of shifting around parts of the image, shift around the different channels by different amounts. Here is an image with one pixel in four shifted:
![Pretty purple lightning](https://github.com/Diusrex/Alter-Image/blob/master/Examples/Channel%20Shift%20Example.jpg)

Finally, an example where every channel of every pixel was shifted around:

What can I say, I was pretty bored this week.
